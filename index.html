                <p> Animation is the method that encompasses myriad filmmaking techniques, by which still images are manipulated to create moving images.
                    Animation, the art of making inanimate objects appear to move. 
                    Animation is an artistic impulse that long predates the movies. 
                    History’s first recorded animator is Pygmalion of Greek and Roman mythology,
                    a sculptor who created a figure of a woman so perfect that he fell in love with her and begged Venus to bring her to life. 
                    Some of the same sense of magic, mystery, and transgression still adheres to contemporary film animation, 
                    which has made it a primary vehicle for exploring the overwhelming, often bewildering emotions of childhood—feelings once dealt with by folktales.
